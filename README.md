The UC Irvine Machine Learning repository contains many datasets for conducting computer science research. One of them is the Haberman’s Survival dataset, available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman’s+Survival. This program parses data files and prints meaningful and readable information to a new file.
